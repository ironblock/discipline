//! `diet-drive` -- run a scripted session and write the record it produced.
//!
//! The half a function call cannot reach. `diet::drive::run` is exercised by
//! unit tests; this runs the same drive as a *program*, writes the archive to
//! a file, and leaves `diet check-record` to return the verdict on it. A lane
//! that only ever called the library would be a lane that never proved a file
//! could be written and read back by a second process.
//!
//! # Two modes, and neither of them guesses
//!
//! With no endpoint it serves the canned script itself: a loopback stub
//! playing [`diet::drive::canned::acts`], no weights, no GPU, no network out.
//! With an endpoint it calls that server. **No model is required and none is
//! invented** -- a run that needs one and has not been given one is the
//! second mode, and it fails with what the server said rather than falling
//! back to the first.
//!
//! # What it will not do
//!
//! Record v0's `regime` needs six facts about the substrate. Regimen v1
//! carries `arm`, `dogma_version` and a substrate *name*; the other four --
//! the model, the quantization, the reasoning state, the hardware -- are read
//! from keys named after the record's own field paths, and a regimen missing
//! any of them is refused. Inventing "unknown" for a regime tag is the
//! incomparable-regime failure this whole schema exists to prevent, and it
//! costs nothing to refuse instead.
//!
//! **Whether those four belong in the regimen format is the regimen owner's
//! call, not this program's.** Until it is made, the key names here are this
//! program's convention and are disclosed as one.
