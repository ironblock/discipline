# Three rules this script exists to keep:

#   * Bind to real exit codes. No `cmd | tee`, no `cmd | grep`, nothing that
#     puts a pipeline's status where a command's status belongs. Every check
#     runs with its own streams and its status is captured directly.
#   * A gate that has never been seen red is not a gate. `--selftest` copies
#     the tree, injects one deliberate fault per check, and runs *this same
#     script* against it.
#   * Red is not enough: a case must go red *for its own fault*. Each seeded
#     case declares the signature its log must carry. The exit code is still
#     the verdict; the signature only decides whether that verdict is about
#     the fault we seeded. Without it a stale build artifact can make an
#     untested gate look proven.
#
# Exit 0 if every check passed, 1 if any failed, 2 if the script was misused.
